# What this addon does
Armor attachments are rebalanced and all work in unique, overhauled ways.

However, you are limited to one per category.

Inspiration came from Dead Air, but refactored by me for efficiency and new features.

# Armor Attachment Rework
You are limited to one outfit attachment of a given type. The types are:

### Camelbak
- self explanatory

### Ballistic insert
- (improved) Kevlar insert
- (improved) Carbon steel plate
- (improved) Ceramic inserts
- (improved) UHMWPE inserts

### Back frame
- (improved) Titanium grid
- (improved) Aluminum frame

### Environmental Control Module
- (improved) Surge suppressor/regenerator
- (improved) Life Support Module (replaces Body Cooler)
- (improved) Anomaly Suppression System (replaces Freon Emission)


## Camelbak
Camelbaks now restore hydration to the user.

- Hydration ticks run on a separate clock from thirst ticks. Every ten in-game minutes, or on equip, actor will drink from the Camelbak.
- Drink level scales with actor thirst. Thirstier the actor, the more they drink.
- Camelbak can be directly drank from with right click. This has roughly the same effect as drinking a water flask.
- Camelbak grants stamina as long as it has capacity. Once depleted no bonuses or penalties are provided.
- Camelbaks can be refilled through drag-dropping Flask of Water or Mineral Water.
- Radiation removal aspect of water is lost (which is stupid to begin with).

## Ballistic inserts
- Ballistic armor inserts operate similar to real life now: they absorb impacts of incoming shots to the torso, reducing damage by up to 80%, but at the cost of their condition. Condition loss per hit depends on the type of insert and its rating. At 0%, the insert is destroyed.
- Armor inserts protect against a certain level of armor penetration based on their type and their condition. For example, a mid-size rifle round will easily defeat Kevlar, but will be fully blocked by a ceramic insert.
- Added 2 new armor insert types: Ceramic and Polyethylene. Each insert type has its own attributes. 
- Steel is strong, cheap, durable, but heavy. 
- Kevlar is cheap, durable, light, but weak. 
- Ceramic is protective and fairly light, but won't last many hits. 
- PE is well-rounded, but very expensive.
- Armor inserts are available from all technicians. Providing tools to a technician will unlock the better armor inserts.
- Armor inserts will drop semi-frequently from stalkers.
- Armor inserts can be repaired on a limited basis with Field Armor toolkits.
- (OPTIONAL) Armor inserts can be repaired at technicians with MCM option.

## Titanium Grid / Aluminum Frame
- Now goes directly into the backpack. Cannot be worn on belt.

## Surge Suppressor
- Surge Suppressors heavily reduce electrical damage taken, working effectively like ballistic inserts for electricity.
- As the device takes electrical damage, the resistors inside blow out, reducing their condition. At no condition, no protection is afforded.
- Surge Suppressors can be repaired with electronic parts, either by drag-drop or by right clicking.

## Autodoc
- Replaces Body Cooler
- Refillable with stimpacks, metamizole, morphine and antirads
- Automatically provides health when health falls below certain thresholds
- Automatically provides morphine/painkillers when in combat and health falls below certain thresholds.
- Automatically adminsters antirad doses when radiation gets high enough.
- Cooldown of 15 seconds between each dose.

## Anomaly Suppression System
- Replaces Freon Emission Module
- Grants a brief period of immunity when touching most anomalies.
- Default cooldown of 60 seconds, can be reduced via upgrades or wearing SEVA/SSP suits.
- Reduced drop chance, slightly higher on Ecologists.

Crafting recipes, trader availability and drop chances have all been automatically tweaked to account for these new items.
