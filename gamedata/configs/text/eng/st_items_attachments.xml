		<text>Densely covered with short and stiff fur, the pelt of pseudodog remains one of the most useful, widespread and versatile mutant pelts available in the Zone. It can be easily attached to armour with even lightest of tools, and yet it's quite durable, which makes it suitable for medium-grade outfit repairs. When used as a whole - it can cover significant area of the body with protective layer which increases resistance to both physical damage and heat. The fur also provides effective insulation. However, as is the case with all such pelts, it easily catches radioactive and toxic particles, so it is highly advised to remove it when in radioactive or toxic areas.\n \n

	<string id="st_hide_psy_dog_descr">
		<text>The fur of a psy dog is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and rare clothing materials in the world. Usually snow white or grey, it is in great demand and can be sold for a hefty sum of money. It's probably made its way into fashion industry thanks to smugglers some of whom have recently turned to hunting mutants. For those in the Zone, it can serve as a blanket, especially during cold nights, and offers efficient rupture protection and mild psy influence reduction when head part of the fur is used as a mask or a hood. However, it easily catches radioactive and toxic particles, so it is highly advised to remove it when in radioactive or toxic areas. Hunters wear it with pride, but only if the creature was slain by their own hands.\n \n

		<text>"Diamond powder" is a common name given to crystal-like substance sometimes found in the belly of all species of psy creatures. It is not known what metabolic processes lead to its emergence and for this reason scientists are eager to pay large sums of money to lay their hands on it. Practical use is limited but some stalkers are known to sprinkle their most cherished hunting knives with it as it makes sharpening significantly easier. It also makes blades look shiny and well-kept.\n \n
