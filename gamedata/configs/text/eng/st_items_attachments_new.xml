		<text>Surge Protector</text>

	<string id="st_af_new_surge_descr">
		<text>A small albeit advanced device consisting of a ton of resistors and replaceable fuses. It protects the user by limiting the effective amount of electricity that comes into direct contact with the body through diverting it to the fuses, and subsequently blowing them. This makes it almost foolproof against Electro Anomalies, but it can only endure so many strong electric shocks before all the fuses are blown out. Most stalkers construct these devices with spare electronic trash, which is in no shortage in the Zone. Even though the device is heavy and disposable, it is extremely useful for navigating electrical anomaly fields. As with all metal objects, it can be used as a source of repair material as long as one has appropriate tools and enough skill.\n \n

		<text>Anomaly Suppression System</text>
	  </string>
	  <string id="st_ass_descr">
		<text>
		  Advanced device with several scanners, transmitters, and emitters for radiowaves, electromagnetic waves, and high-pitch sonar waves. One of the first devices designed by the Ministry of Science to protect their field agents, this sophisticated machine embodies Suslov's 'tapping the fish tank' theory, where certain anomalies can be temporarily disrupted if enough environmental disturbance is introduced. The device automatically scans local anomalies and emits a combined neutralizing pulse in response to anomaly activation, effectively shutting it down temporarily and negating all hazard. Devices such as these form the bulk of active anomalous defense systems in the SSP and SEVA suits, which both feature integrated versions of this device. The device comes with a self-recharging battery for the suppression pulse, however, the onboard computer needs time to recalibrate and recalculate field changes that occur after each pulse. The device can be combined with the onboard support systems of the SSP and SEVA suits to enhance its effectiveness and recharge time.

		<text>
		  Next-generation anomaly suppression device incorporating telemetry data from rare artifact samples to compute suppression solutions more quickly. This device is the pinnacle of anomaly protection systems and is in extremely high demand with all science personnel, not to mention stalkers themselves. Additional data from the incorporated artifact sample allows pulses to be transmitted with less disturbance to the environment, allowing for recalibration cycles to occur more frequently. In addition, the device emits a constant field that passively reduces the strength of nearby anomaly fields. The device can be combined with the onboard support systems of the SSP and SEVA suits to enhance its effectiveness and recharge time.

Application of carefully contained healing artifacts has both boosted the effectiveness of the administered medicine as well as passively encouraging cell growth. Small numbers of these Autodoc Modules have been produced owing in part to the difficulty in sourcing the right manufacturing materials. Despite that, they are highly popular and sought after amongst Spetsnaz units and Ecologists, even though the pain of the forearm injector is arguably worse than before.\n
