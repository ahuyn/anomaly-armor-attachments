		<text>Made of hard boron carbide ceramics, this type of armor insert is used by armed forces all over the world due to its ability to protect against high-caliber threats. Known as the SAPI in the west, it dissipates the energy of incoming projectiles by cracking the ceramic into pieces, protecting the wearer. However, this mechanism also makes its multi-hit protection poor. Ceramic inserts also tend to be quite thick, restricting movement.\n \n

		<text>Polyethylene (PE) is widely used in a variety of industrial and commercial products due to its simple nonreactive chemical structure and versatile properties. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which comprises these armor inserts, provides incredible protective strength for its low weight. Incoming projectiles locally melt the polymer through friction, trapping the bullet within the insert. This mechanism gives PE plates unparallelled multi-hit protection capability. However, UHMWPE is very expensive, and cannot fully stop higher-caliber projectiles on its own.\n \n%c[d_red]\n\n%c[d_red]WARNING:%c[ui_gray_2]\n \n%c[default]UHWMPE ballistic inserts are highly sensitive to heat and will fail when exposed to high temperature situations.

		<text>A set of extremely heavy hardened-steel armor inserts. While they will protect against some high-caliber rounds, have good multi-hit capability, and are reasonably cheap, these benefits come at the cost of high weight. For this reason, soldiers of armies have opted for lighter ceramic inserts, while steel inserts such as these are mainly purchased by civilians. In the Zone, steel plates like these are a principal component of exoskeleton body armor, as the support structure easily offsets the great weight.
